# Poker application

This is the reference application for the poker game that is being developed as part of the agile software engineering training.

- This repository is supposed to be forked for your training so that you can share code changes among your training team
- The code requires at least Java 7 and Maven 3 to compile and package
- If you use Eclipse as an IDE, import the project as "Existing Maven project"
- The code is packaged as a web archive (.war), so you can deploy it to a servlet container - it is tested with Tomcat 8
- Once you deploy the packaged web archive, the application will respond at the root URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080/poker)
